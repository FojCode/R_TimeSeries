# Sample autocovariance function 

# Sample time series data (replace with your actual data)
data <- rnorm(100)  # Generate 100 random normal values

# Calculate ACVF with 20 lags (adjust max.lag as needed)
acvf <- acf(data, lh = 0, uh = 20, type = "covariance")

# Plot the ACVF
plot(acvf, main = "Sample Autocovariance Function", xlab = "Lag", ylab = "Autocovariance")

# Add reference lines (optional)
abline(h = 0, col = "gray")  # Add horizontal line at 0

# Customize the plot further with additional arguments to plot()

# Sample autocorrelation function of time series
